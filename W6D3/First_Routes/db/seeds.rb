# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# User.create!(name: "Carly", email: "carly@yahoo.com")
# User.create!(name: "Paul", email: "paul@gmail.com")
# User.create!(name: "Jeremy", email: "jeremy@hotmail.com")
# User.create!(name: "Wolf", email: "wolfy@mypack.com")
